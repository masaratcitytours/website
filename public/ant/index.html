	<p>A tour of Bachoura and Basta’s Antique Market</p>
<p>The tour explores the Basta’s &ldquo;Antiques Market&rdquo; with a focus on understanding its origins by tracing the trajectories of the early families engaged in this trade as well as the socio-political and economic conditions that accompanied their earliest arrival to the area.
More broadly, the tour tries to paint a picture of the Bashoura district&rsquo;s formation during the period of Beirut’s transformation from a fisherman town to a central port city on the Mediterranean with sprawling suburbs.
The tour offers space for discussion, shopping, coffee, and conversation with the locals and shop owners.</p>
<p>By investigating and archiving the historical beginnings of the Antique Market and its connection to Beirut&rsquo;s expansion as an economic hub in the late 19th century, and later as a cultural hub in the 20th century, the tour hopes to weave a narrative that pushes Basta’s Antique Market as an extension of Beirut’s traditional souks, which were completely razed during the City Center&rsquo;s redevelopment project.</p>

About Downtown Tour
The Beirut Architecture Tour is a walking tour in Beirut’s Central District and was a result of my attempt to explore the city center’s remaining and disappeared heritage by following a narrative of planning practices- and the lack thereof- that shaped Beirut throughout its history. The project inspected the topic of heritage from my unique perspective as an architect and urban researcher. It aimed to paint a vivid picture to the participants of the elements of the city that had disappeared and the unseen forces that have and continue to shape it.</p>
