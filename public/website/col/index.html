	<p>A Tool for Research: The Potential of Walking Tours with Molly T. Oringer
Project Date: May 2019</p>
<p>Information, maps, and real data about the SOLIDERE project are quite scarce, often single-sourced (SOLIDERE being the source), and not at all representative of reality.</p>
<p>This Wadi Abu Jmil tour was born out of a collaboration between Beirut Architecture Tours and Molly T. Oringer, who is working on her own project “that explores the legacies of formerly Jewish spaces in Lebanon in the absence of a Jewish community.” Our tour mainly focused on the history of the neighborhood that once was a vibrant residential area and housed the largest Jewish population in the city. Beyond informing of the neighborhood’s past, the tour was an attempt at understanding people’s curiosities about that part of town, and thus guiding our future research in the area.

Curating the Tour Series: Another Beirut- with Public Works Studio
Project Date: July-October 2019</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another City Series: Housing Narratives&rdquo; is a collection of tours that uncover the social history of three inner-city neighborhoods in Beirut—Roum/Badaw, Bachoura, and Tarik Jdideh—revealing stories of place-making often overlooked by the broad narratives shaped by modern urban planning practices. These tours trace the evolving housing landscape in these historic residential areas, highlighting the impact of economic liberalism, a booming real estate market, and shortsighted governmental policies that promote an urban development model that normalizes displacement and obscures the rich, diverse fabric of the older city. The tours also shed light on the challenges faced by long-time Beirut residents as the state&rsquo;s role shifts from a provider of housing—albeit limited to rent control—to a supporter of real estate-driven visions, raising crucial questions about alternative housing and development futures for the city.</p>
<p>As part of this project, Jana Haidar trained a group of young local residents from these neighborhoods to become tour guides within their own communities. This initiative aimed not only to engage the youth in local socio-political issues but also to equip them with the tools to conduct their own research and inspire further community involvement.</p>
<p>The tours were conducted between September and October 2019 and debuted as a featured event during Beirut Design Week 2019.</p>
