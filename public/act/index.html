Mapping Wadi Abu Jmil with Molly T. Oringer
(Re)discovering Beirut’s Valley of the Jews
Event Date: May 26, 2019</p>
<p>This tour adopted an experimental approach, exploring walking tours as potential tools for research. It invited practitioners and enthusiasts of art, architecture, photography, planning, and design to participate in an interactive walk, collectively mapping the various elements of Wadi Abu Jmil. Once a vibrant quarter in Beirut’s city center and home to the largest Jewish population in Lebanon, the Valley now stands quiet, posh, heavily securitized, and devoid of signs of life.
Molly is a sociocultural anthropologist and postdoctoral researcher at Durham University (UK). She chronicles our Wadi Abo Jmil tour in her dissertation Spatial Relations: Post-War Reconstruction and the Afterlives of Jewish Terrains in Lebanon (UCLA, 2023), where she argues the ability of walking tours as a tool to counter state-sanctioned narratives of heritage and development.
