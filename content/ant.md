A tour of Bachoura and Basta’s Antique Market

The tour explores the Basta’s "Antiques Market" with a focus on understanding its origins by tracing the trajectories of the early families engaged in this trade as well as the socio-political and economic conditions that accompanied their earliest arrival to the area. 
More broadly, the tour tries to paint a picture of the Bashoura district's formation during the period of Beirut’s transformation from a fisherman town to a central port city on the Mediterranean with sprawling suburbs.
The tour offers space for discussion, shopping, coffee, and conversation with the locals and shop owners.

By investigating and archiving the historical beginnings of the Antique Market and its connection to Beirut's expansion as an economic hub in the late 19th century, and later as a cultural hub in the 20th century, the tour hopes to weave a narrative that pushes Basta’s Antique Market as an extension of Beirut’s traditional souks, which were completely razed during the City Center's redevelopment project.

About Downtown Tour
The Beirut Architecture Tour is a walking tour in Beirut’s Central District and was a result of my attempt to explore the city center’s remaining and disappeared heritage by following a narrative of planning practices- and the lack thereof- that shaped Beirut throughout its history. The project inspected the topic of heritage from my unique perspective as an architect and urban researcher. It aimed to paint a vivid picture to the participants of the elements of the city that had disappeared and the unseen forces that have and continue to shape it.
