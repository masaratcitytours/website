“Space is not a scientific object removed from ideology or politics. It has always been political and strategic. There is an ideology of space. Because space, which seems homogeneous, which appears as a whole in its objectivity…, is a social product.”
Henri Lefebvre, The Survival of Capitalism

Masarat is a project that curates walking city tours, weaving narratives of placemaking that go beyond the official, state-conforming narratives of history and heritage. These tours are rooted in rigorous research, exploring the social, cultural, economic, and political contexts that have shaped the development of spaces and communities within the city.

Why?
Masarat kicked off as my attempt to explore Beirut. It evolved along with my career in urban research as a unique tool offering new perspectives on the conception of space in Beirut through history. The project also experiments with the prospects and potential of a walking tour as not just a research output, but also a research tool. Several collaborations between Masarat and other researchers and research institutions attest to the versatile roles a walking tour can play throughout the life cycle of a research project.
